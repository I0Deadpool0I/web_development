This is my login_signup_calculator project:-

In this project I have created a login ,a sign up page and a calculator with the help of HTML, CSS & Java Script and linked them together.(i.e. loginpage.php, signup.php, index.php ,cal.js and Style.css) (i'll tell you later why i changed the extension to php). Then i installed "xampp" on my pc as we are using xampp (apache and MySQL) as database to store our signup user data. Then i set up the database at phpMyAdmin. Once i finished setting up the database ,i copy my files to a folder i created named "signup page" to xampp\htdocs then i opened that folder in vscode i changed their extension to php and made a php file named "db.php" (this file is to connect all the files to database) then i added php codes (backend codes) to the signup and login page;

We  are finally done now we can access to our files by typing "localhost/signup%20page/loginpage.php" in your favourite browser;

Thanks:)
